        <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
        <p>The newspapers are the storehouse of day-to-day happenings in the world.
             They add to our knowledge not only about our own country but also about world affairs.
              The newspapers also express their opinion about social and political problems through their editorials. 
              They, mold the readers into their own way of thinking. That is why the newspaper is considered a power.
               In a democracy, the press is a link between the government and the people.
                It gives news as to what the government is doing. It reflects public opinion as well.
                 It arouses national consciousness on important matters. It teaches the citizens their rights and responsibilities.
                  Every newspaper does not, however, produce a healthy effect. A newspaper should be neutral. It should be fearless and just.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>With advancements in the means of transport, traveling has become a means of education. 
                    Education here does not mean bookish knowledge. 
                    It means a complete understanding of the current ways in which our society and the world work.
                     Bookish knowledge gives us theoretical details.
                      Traveling gives us practical experience. 
                      It is, therefore, quite essential that we move from place to place. 
                      Students must travel now and then to know for themselves how the world is going.
                       Businessmen have to travel to acquire knowledge of business techniques.
                        Even doctors and lawyers must travel to improve the quality of their work. 
                        People travel not only for the sake of pleasure alone. 
                        They travel to gain experience which books fail to teach them</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Character is the greatest quality of a person.
                             It has been rightly said: “If wealth is lost, nothing is lost; if health is lost, something is lost; but if the character is lost, everything is lost.
                             ” Character depends upon training. Training starts from the cradle and ends in the grave.
                              Character means virtuous habits and qualities. A man of character lives for others.
                               He shapes society. He builds a nation. He is a source of strength to others. 
                               All great men found a place in history because of their character.
                                Some people become great because of encouragement by great character.
                                 It was the mother of Shivaji who was behind his greatness.
                                  A man of character is like a light-house. He is a great source of inspiration for others.</p>
